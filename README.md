# Text-Analytics
Comparing Classification of text in Offensive Language Identification dataset(OLID) after studying of classification techniques and selecting the two best models.

#Objective

The report focuses on classifying the text in the OLID dataset using a range of classification techniques. The objective is to choose the two most suitable models for application. After a detailed analysis of various text categorization techniques, the study applied the OLID dataset to assess each techniqueâ€™s performance. Two models have been determined to have the best performance, and their use is noted. This study provides significant knowledge on text categorization techniques and shows how well they handle the OLID dataset 
#Results 

The two models SVM and Logistic Regression are carried out to classify the given OLID dataset, after studying various research papers. The classifiers are implemented after cleaning and preprocessing the data, and vectorization is done. The classification is done and by seeing the performance score of both the models, Logistic Regression outperforms the SVM, as it has the F1 score of 0.720453 with an 0.79767 accuracy, whereas SVM has the F1 score of 0.71790 with an accuracy of 0.78139. 

#Conclusion

Although there is a slight difference between two the classification models, the logistic model having the more value is considered the best classification model for the OLID dataset.
